Raspberry Pi & Arduino article for The MagPi

All included materials CC-BY-SA - 2012-09-03

Tested on:
* Raspbian Linux 3.2.27+ #102 PREEMPT Sat Sep 1 01:00:50 BST 2012
  armv6l GNU/Linux

* Python 2.7.3rc2

Essential files
===============

* raspberry_pi_and_arduino.odt - the article text. Any styling was
  done through character and paragraph styles. No embedded images to
  keep the size down

* ArduinoFirmata_bb.png - the bitmap version of the circuit diagram

* arduino_firmata_tk.py - the Python source.


Optional files
==============

* small-arduino_firmata_tk-screenshot.png - screen dump (using 'scrot
  -bu') of the program window

* arduino-board_menu.png - Arduino IDE config menu item to choose
  which type of board to use

* arduino-serial_menu.png - Arduino IDE config menu item to choose
  which serial port to use

* rpi_arduino-00bright.jpg - camera shot of Arduino atop Raspberry Pi
  with screen display and LED at 0 brightness

* rpi_arduino-05bright.jpg - camera shot of Arduino atop Raspberry Pi
  with screen display and LED at 5% brightness

* rpi_arduino-31bright.jpg - camera shot of Arduino atop Raspberry Pi
  with screen display and LED at 31% brightness

* rpi_arduino-top.jpg - camera shot of Arduino atop Raspberry Pi.


Very optional files
===================

* ArduinoFirmata_bb.svg - Vector version of circuit diagram produced
  by Fritzing. Would probably be an exercise in pain to open on a
  Raspberry Pi

* arduino-sketches_folder.png - What you (sometimes) see when starting
  the Arduino IDE for the first time

* arduino-ide.png - How the Arduino IDE looks on Raspberry Pi

* ArduinoFirmata.fzz - the Fritzing source for the circuit diagram.
