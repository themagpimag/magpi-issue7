I wanted to ask if you could mention our Raspberry Pi nights at Bloominglabs (the Hackerspace in Bloomington, IN, USA) on your page where you list events. We hold these at our space the first Tuesday of every month at 7pm. Our URL is http://Bloominglabs.org - people can find our address and such there.
